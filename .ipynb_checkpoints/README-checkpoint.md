# Excel-Challenge
## Week 1 Assignment

This assignment was to show knowledge obtained with various codes in Excel Spreadsheet.
<br>
We were given a preload Excel spreadsheet with KickStarter Campaigns. <br>
* The goal was to show ability to use conditional filters on the file, create additional columns based on the data to show: <br>
    1.`Percent Funded` <br>
    2.`Average Donation` <br>
    3.`Category` <br>
    4.`Sub-Category`<br>
* Create a column named `Date Created Coversion` that uses the formula to convert the data from the `launched_at` column to Excel's date format<br>
* Create a column named `Date Ended Conversion` that uses the formula to convert the data from the `deadline` column to Excel's date format
<br>
<br>
The next part of the assignment was to:<br>
* Create a new sheet with a pivot table to analyze the data from the worksheet:<br>
    * Count how manycampaigns were successful, failed,canceled, or are currently live per **category**.<br>
    * Create a stacked column pivot chart that can be filtered by country based on the pivot table created.<br>
* Create a new sheet with a pivot table that will analyze the worksheet to:<br>
    * Count how many campaings were successful, failed, or canceled, or are currently live per **sub-category**.<br>
    * Create a stacked column pivot chart that can be filtered by country and parent-category based on the pivot table created. <br>
* Create a new sheet with a pivot table with a:<br>
    * Column of `state`<br>
    * Rows of `Date Created Conversion`, with values based on the count of `state` and filters based on `parent category` and `Years`.<br>
    * Create a pivot chart line graph that visualizes this new table.
<br>

#### Analyzing the Data
After completeing the various Pivot Charts and graphs we were to answer the following questions:<br>
* What are the three conclusions we can draw about the Kickstarted Campaigns?<br>
* What are some limitations of this dataset?<br>
* What are some other possible Table and/or graphs we could create?<br>
